# BMI-Calculator-with-Graphical-Interface-
This project is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator interface with a graphical interface. The calculator helps determine the 
health of a person based on their height and weight measurements. Height and weight measurements are key indicators in determining 
a person’s BMI score. 

There are two designated text boxes to enter height. One text box is for entering height in feet and the other one is for entering 
height in inches. Text box color will change to red if the height input does not pass conditions or if the textbox is blank. Text boxes 
have multiple conditions to check if the input value number is greater than 0 and only numbers are inputted, and no characters are entered. 
If the height adds up to 0 then a popup window will alert the user stating, “height total must be greater than 0 inches”. Height in feet and 
inches needs to add up to more than 0 to calculate the BMI. Next, there are two sliders to select the weight and temperature of the person. 
Sliders are designed to not let users select the number 0 for weight and temperature. The scale starts at number 1.

The BMI score will be displayed after the measurements are recorded in the interface. The result will be displayed with a number and a phrase 
stating whether the person is considered underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese. The final BMI score will be displayed on top of an 
image designated to the BMI score. The picture of a cartoon person will be displayed based on the BMI score. If the interface calculates that
the score is underweight, then the underweight image will be displayed with a thin cartoon person and so on so forth for other BMI scores. 
BMI Number Scale: • Underweight = <18.5 • Normal weight = 18.5–24.9 • Overweight = 25–29.9 • Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater
